                    Maryam one of my most favourite monkeys. I love her so much. She's a very close and trustworthy person to me and I love when we send eachother photos of random things. I enjoyed that day at the hotel so much, honestly on of the best days ever. We clicked so well and Im so grateful and happy we're friends.

                    This is Sofia, one of my closest friends. I love spending time with her and talking to her. Everytime we hangout we always spill the tea and she gives the best, tightest hugs in the world and I feel so safe with her and I just melt in her arms. The time we spend together is always so fun and meaningful. We laugh so much together and then have deep conversations and thats something great to have.

                    This is Katya. My friend since I was 5 and it's been almost 10 years and we're still going strong. We don't see eachother but we talk often and I'm so happy that we stayed in touch after all these years. We play video games together even though I suck but its still fun.
